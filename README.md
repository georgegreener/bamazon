# Bamazon!

    Bamazon is a global, online supermarket where people with access to this code can imagine themselves buying a handful of mock items.

###It's as easy as 1-2-3...

    Simply run the code via Node to bring up a list of available items.

    Bamazon will then ask you for the ID of the item you'd like to purchase, as well as how many of that item you'd like. Just be sure not to order more than what's in stock!

###BAM!!!

    Bamazing! It's that easy!
