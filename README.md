# Bamazon!

    Bamazon is a global, online supermarket where people with access
    to this code can imagine themselves buying a handful of mock items.

### Simple setup

    You'll need to install a few Node packages to get Bamazon up and running.
    Don't worry, it's easy! Just type these commands into Bash.
    
    npm install mysql
    npm install inquirer
    
    That's it!

### It's as easy as 1-2-3...

    Then type "node bamazonCustomer" into Bash to run it.
    
    The program will automatically list all the items available for purchase.

    Bamazon will ask you for the ID of the item you'd like to purchase.
    You can also choose how much of that item you'd like to get.
    Just be sure not to order more than what's in stock!
